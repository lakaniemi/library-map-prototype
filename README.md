# Library map prototype

This is meant to be a quick, but still usable prototype made for Aalto University coursework. If you're here to see some good quality code, you're in the wrong place :)

## Requirements

* Node (see `.nvmrc` for used version)
* Yarn
* netlify-cli (`npm install -g netlify-cli`)

## Deployment

The site is hosted in Netlify: https://library-map-prototype.netlify.app/

Commits to master will be automatically deployed.

Use `netlify open` to access the admin console. To do a manual deploy, use `netlify deploy`.

## Develop

Run `yarn start` to start up development server.
